## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email` or `Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the contact page map. The addresses we have on the design are fictional, so you'll need to add real addresses for this bonus task.

### Expected Behaviour

The following points are to clarify behaviour for areas where you might not be sure what's expected.

#### Home

- When one of the 3 Featured projects near the bottom are clicked, navigate to the `/portfolio` page.

#### Portfolio

- The thumbnails on the `/portfolio` index page should be anchor tags but should not link anywhere. If this were a real site, these could link to the project websites individually.

#### Contact

- Clicking on "View on Map" should scroll down to the map if you're using the static images
- If you're using Google Maps, clicking on "View on Map" should highlight the office that the link was clicked for
